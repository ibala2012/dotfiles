I have mostly cloned okubax original old dot files, I have modified
very few things to suit my needs with some minor changes to in terms of my utility.
I have also modified the vim set of things to reflect my liking by adding some
changes used on my use cases.
I extensively use Manjaro Linux and borrow lot of stuff of arch user repository.
I will try to update these files as and when I change something.
Special thanks to okubax for maintaining a nice folder structure for me to borrow.

I still prefer bash over zsh :D, so I have bashrc listed.
I also would request people to download relevant packages as needed.

Special thanks to all different developers for helping me create a nice setup.
